# ðŸ¤“ 3D Game Programming All In One book ðŸ¤“ 



### One was once bored...

And decided to learn how to craft a game engine, but this time in Rust.

"But Liro, do you habe any prior SOLID experience in game engine programming?"

Absolutely not.

"What about your rust skills, are they Solid? like have you used it extensively just like you have with TypeScript?"

Ha! (laugh).



### Well, there we go.

Check the [Anotations](.wholeproject/anotations/intro.md) to see me getting a little bit crazier every chapter that I go through.
